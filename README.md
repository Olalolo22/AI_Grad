# AI_Grad
# PROJECT IDEA: I will be making changes to the existing Polling App created during the course of the programme.
# TECH STACK: 
PROGRAMMING - TYPESCRIPT
STYLING - TYPESCRIPT
UI COMPONENTS - SHADCN UI
FRAMEWORK - NEXR.js

# METHOD OF AI INTEGRATION 
AI will be used to generate tests for both happy and edge cases to make sure it covers all areas.
AI will be used to discuss new ideas and features
AI will be fed appropriate context for it to generate suitable functions based on the Schema.

I will be using the Cursor IDE for this project. I will use the chat panel to deeply discuss and argue cases or alternatives to generated functions. I will also use inline recommendations to fix errors quickly or spin up mundane functions.

Sample Prompts will include : "I’m building a login feature for my full stack NextJS polling app. Users will authenticate via email and password using Supabase. Help me break this down. I am not looking for implementation details but rather what is required to make this work and how does the integration with Supabase work?"

"I’ve created a new Next.js polling app project. I want to prepare it for upcoming features like user authentication, viewing polls, and creating a new poll. Help me scaffold an initial folder structure and placeholder files for those areas. Use Shadcn components."

"I am looking to refactor the polls_submit function in the @polls file, walk me through the different ways and explain the effects and consequences"
